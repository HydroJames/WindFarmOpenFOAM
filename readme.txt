This is the OpenFOAM solver and a base case as used in the published journal article:
"Evaluation of an offshore wind farm computational fluid dynamics model against operational site data"

The solver code in is the solver folder and uses a modified version of Eric Svenning's actuator disk code.
For an explanation of the modifications please see the above referenced paper.
A base case which runs the solver can be found in the BaseMain folder.
I believe that these are the most up to date files but I could be mistaken.
This was written for OpenFOAM v4 but was also used on v5.
